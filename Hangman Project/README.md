The **Hangman Game** is a Python project inspired by the classic word-guessing game. In this game, users attempt to guess the letters of a randomly selected word, with each incorrect guess resulting in the gradual hanging of a stick figure. The objective is to guess the word before the man is fully hung!

## Key Features:

- A random word is selected for each new game, challenging the user to guess the word letter by letter.
- For every wrong guess, the hangman drawing progresses, bringing the player closer to defeat.
- The game ends when:
  - The user successfully guesses the complete word.
  - The stick figure is fully drawn, signifying a loss.
  
This project implements the classic hangman experience in a fun and interactive way, bringing the nostalgia of the popular pen-and-paper game to life through Python!
