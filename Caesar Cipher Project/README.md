The **Caesar Cipher Project** is a Python-based encryption and decryption tool inspired by the classic Caesar cipher technique. In this project, users can encrypt and decrypt text messages by specifying a key, which represents the number of positions by which each letter in the message is shifted. This simple yet effective cipher allows users to transform their text securely.

## Key Features:

- **Encryption**: The user can input a message and a key (shift number), and the program will output an encrypted message where each letter is shifted by the specified key.
- **Decryption**: The program also allows the user to reverse the process by providing the encrypted message and the key, restoring the original message.
- **Customizable Key**: The shift key can be any number, positive or negative, providing flexibility in the encryption process.

## Benefits of This Project:

- **Data Protection**: The Caesar cipher adds a layer of security, making it harder for unauthorized users to read the original message.
- **Hands-on Learning**: This project is a great way to understand the basics of cryptography and how encryption techniques work.
- **Customizable**: Users can choose their key, allowing for different levels of encryption based on personal preference or need.
- **Simple and Efficient**: The Caesar cipher is easy to implement, making it an excellent tool for beginners to explore the concepts of cryptography.
